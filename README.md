# RSS Email Feed

RSS Email Feed is a simple Python script that sends an email with the latest RSS feed entries from a given URL (to be
determined what exactly it does).

## About

To practice for my new role as Software Technical Lead, I thought it smart to create a dummy python
script that parses RSS code and sends a sort of newsletter to a given email.

## Usage

To use this, fork the project, clone it to your local machine, and install dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
Then, run the script with the following command:

```bash
